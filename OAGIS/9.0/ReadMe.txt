These XML reference files continue to evolve.  Please feel
free to use them, but check www.openapplications.org for the most 
recent updates.

OAGIS 9.0 contains XML Schema, constraint XSL, constraint XPath and
example XML documents. In order to view XML Schema it is recommended 
that you use an XML IDE, as the complete structure of the Business 
Object Documents are not viewable from a single file.

Note that the sample files were used to verify the XMLSchema 
development, and do not necessarily reflect actual business 
transactions.  In many cases,the data fields in the XML files are just 
placeholder text.  Real-world examples for each transaction will be 
provided as they become available.


Please send suggestions or bug reports to oagis@openapplications.org

Thank you for your interest and support.
